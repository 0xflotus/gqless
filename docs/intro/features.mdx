## Invisible data fetching

Simply access data and it will magically appear. Queries are generated automatically, so you never need to write a line of GraphQL again.


## Typescript

Typescript support is **built-in** and enabled by default. Run code-generation *only when your API changes*.

## Editor intellisense

You get awesome DX out the box, with docs displayed inline (no extensions required)

## [Extensions](/docs/extensions)

Declaratively add client-only fields, which are automatically type-safe.

> Comparable to `apollo-link-state`, with more flexiblity

## Cache

The built-in cache automatically caches everything for you

### Custom behaviour

Extensions offer a composable API, through which custom behaviour can be defined.

### Updating cache

TODO
