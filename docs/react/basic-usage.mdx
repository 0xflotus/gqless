Using gqless with React is quite simple. All components that contain `gqless` data objects, should be wrapped in `graphql()` for:

- Automatic updates
- React suspense
- Query combining

## Installation

First ensure you've installed the package from NPM:

```bash
yarn add @gqless/react
# or
npm install @gqless/react
```

## Example

```jsx
import { query } from './gqless'
import { graphql } from '@gqless/react'

const App = graphql(() => {
  return <div>{query.hello}</div>
})
```

## React suspense

gqless was designed around the concept of React Suspense. Instead of components handling loading states, they should render as if the data was always there.

## Automatic updates

Selections referenced on render, will trigger components to update whenever they change.

### Example

Updating the cache when a button is pressed:

```jsx
import { query } from './gqless'
import { graphql } from '@gqless/react'

const App = graphql(() => {
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => (query.hello = 'Updates')}></button>
      {query.hello}
    </>
  )
})
```

## Query combining

gqless combines component data requirements into a single query. See [custom queries (/react/custom-queries) for details on how to split them up
