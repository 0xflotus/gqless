From previously working on a large GraphQL codebase, I had nightmares around the repetition involved with shipping new features.

## What

**gqless** is a fundamentally new approach to a GraphQL client. It makes using your API enjoyable, by **generating GraphQL queries at runtime**.

#### Your app

```jsx
const App = graphql(() => (
  <div>
    Hello {query.me.name}!
    {query.users({ limit: 10 }).map(user => (
      <User key={user.id} user={user} />
    ))}
  </div>
))
```

#### Generated query

<!--prettier-ignore -->
```graphql
query App {
  me { name }
  users(limit: 10) { name }
}
```

## Features

### Intellisense

You get awesome DX out the box, with instant feedback on each keypress. Documentation is displayed right in your IDE (without any extensions):

### Extensions

Add client-only fields TODO

## Why

- **My workflow was hindered by maintaining queries**. Updating components, required updating queries - which required running code-generation.

- **I was designing components around queries**

- **Inefficient queries**, due to underutilized nesting. [Relay](https://relay.dev) was the only alternative, but had a steep learning curve + even more boilerplate ðŸ˜¢

## Typical example

Lets say you've just added a new field to your API,

```graphql
type User {
  username: String!
+ avatarUrl(size: Int!): String!
}
```

and you want to display it within multiple places in the UI.

### Conventionally

First you'd need to locate which queries require updating, referring to your browser for documentation:

```graphql
query UserProfile(avatarSize: Int!) {
  user {
    ...
    avatarUrl(size: $avatarSize)
  }
}
```

Typically you'd then run a type generator (IDE may need files to be re-opened, for updates to be reflected).

Finally you'd do the task you set out to do - updating the components,

```jsx
const UserProfile = ({ id }) => {
  const { data } = useQuery(USER_PROFILE, {
    variables: { id, avatarSize: computeSize() },
  })

  return <img src={data.user.avatarUrl} />
}
```

### With gqless

Open the components and make changes, never write another query again:

```jsx
import { query } from './graphql'

const UserProfile = ({ id }) => {
  const user = query.user({ id })

  return <img src={user.avatarUrl({ size: computeSize() })} />
}
```
